        "Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, referring to autonomous systems capable of independently perceiving their environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific goals without constant human intervention.",
        "Unlike traditional AI systems that respond to prompts or follow predefined scripts, agentic AI possesses agency - the ability to set objectives, plan sequences of actions, learn from outcomes, and adapt strategies in real-time. These systems can break down complex tasks into manageable steps, execute them sequentially, and adjust their approach based on feedback.",
        "The term 'agentic' derives from the concept of agency in cognitive science, emphasizing the AI's capacity for autonomous goal-directed behavior. This represents a significant evolution from reactive AI systems to proactive, self-directing intelligent agents that can operate with minimal supervision."

      content: [
        "While both agentic AI and generative AI represent cutting-edge AI technologies, they serve fundamentally different purposes and operate through distinct mechanisms.",
        "**Generative AI** focuses on creating content - text, images, music, code, or other outputs - based on patterns learned from training data. Systems like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Midjourney excel at generating human-like responses or creative artifacts when given prompts. However, they typically operate in a single-step, request-response manner without autonomous goal pursuit.",
        "**Agentic AI**, in contrast, emphasizes autonomous action and goal achievement. Rather than simply generating content in response to prompts, agentic systems can independently plan multi-step processes, interact with external tools and environments, make decisions based on feedback, and persist toward objectives over time.",
        "The key distinction lies in **agency**: generative AI responds to user input, while agentic AI proactively pursues objectives. That said, many modern agentic systems incorporate generative AI capabilities - using large language models for reasoning and planning while adding the autonomous decision-making layer that defines agency.",
        "Think of it this way: asking ChatGPT to write code is generative AI; an AI agent that independently researches, plans, writes, tests, debugs, and deploys a complete application is agentic AI."
